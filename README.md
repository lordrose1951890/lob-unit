Stuffs done in this section (This is also the last section in the book. Despite that,  I'll keep charging forward to 
finish 
this Lobster Unit testing framework):
1. Wrote a test for a TestSuite
2. Wrote part of the implementation, but without making the tes work (a violation of the tdd rule, but perhaps rule 
   are made to be broken?!)
3. Changed the interface of the run() method so that the item and the composite of items could work identical
4. Factored out the common setUp() code
