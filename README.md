Stuffs done in this section:
1. Figured out how to begin with a tiny little step
2. Implementing, first by hardwiring it, then making it more general by replacing constants with variables
3. Used Pluggable Adapter (**Bad!!!** Cause it makes code hard to statically analyze)
4. Bootstrapped our testing framework, all in tiny steps
