Stuffs done in this section:
1. Made small scale test work
2. Wrote larger scale test (testFailedResult)
3. Made the larger test work using the mechanism demonstrated by the smaller test (testFailedResultFormatting)
4. Noticed the potential problem of errors in setUp and noted it rather than resolving it immediately
